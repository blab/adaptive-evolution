              against an evolving virus population. We have thus developed a

              have caused serious respiratory and neurological disease. We
              collected samples from several European countries during the 2018
              outbreak and determined 53 near full-length genome ('whole
              genome') sequences. These sequences were combined with 718 whole
              genome and 1,987 VP1-gene publicly available sequences. In 2018,
              circulating strains clustered into multiple subgroups in the B3
              and A2 subclades, with different phylogenetic origins. Clusters
              in subclade B3 emerged from strains circulating primarily in the
              US and Europe in 2016, though some had deeper roots linking to
              Asian strains, while clusters in A2 traced back to strains
              detected in East Asia in 2015-2016. In 2018, all sequences from
              the USA formed a distinct subgroup, containing only three non-US
              samples. Alongside the varied origins of seasonal strains, we
              found that diversification of these variants begins up to 18
              months prior to the first diagnostic detection during a EV-D68
              season. EV-D68 displays strong signs of continuous antigenic
              evolution and all 2018 A2 strains had novel patterns in the
              putative neutralizing epitopes in the BC- and DE-loops. The
              pattern in the BC-loop of the USA B3 subgroup had not been
              detected on that continent before. Patients with EV-D68 in
              subclade A2 were significantly older than patients with a B3
              subclade virus. In contrast to other subclades, the age
              distribution of A2 is distinctly bimodal and was found primarily
              among children and in the elderly. We hypothesize that EV-D68's
              rapid evolution of surface proteins, extensive diversity, and
              high rate of geographic mixing could be explained by substantial
              reinfection of adults. Better understanding of evolution and
              immunity across diverse viral pathogens, including EV-D68 and
              SARS-CoV-2, is critical to pandemic preparedness in the future.",

              regions are rapidly identified by the fast Fourier transform

              composed of volume and polarity values of each amino acid

              evolving populations and apply it to a large data set of complete
              human influenza A virus genome sequences. In accord with previous
              studies, we observe particularly high rates of adaptive evolution

              to reinfect the same host. To address this, influenza vaccine
              content is reviewed annually to ensure protection is maintained,
              despite the emergence of drift variants; however, it is not
              always possible to capture every significant drift, partly due to
              the timing of the recommendations. Vaccine mismatch can impact on
              vaccine effectiveness, and has significant epidemiological and
              economical consequences, as was seen most apparently in the
              1997-1998 influenza season. To meet the challenge of antigenic
              drift, vaccines that confer broad protection against
              heterovariant strains are needed against seasonal, epidemic and
              pandemic influenza. In addition to the use of vaccine adjuvants,
              emerging research areas include development of a universal
              vaccine and the use of vaccines that exploit mechanisms of
              cross-protective immunity.",

              using a live-virus neutralization assay, we compared the
              neutralization of a non-VOC variant with the 501Y.V2 VOC (also
              known as B.1.351) using plasma collected from adults who were
              hospitalized with COVID-19 during the two waves of infection in
              South Africa, the second wave of which was dominated by
              infections with the 501Y.V2 variant. Sequencing demonstrated that
              infections of plasma donors from the first wave were with viruses
              that did not contain the mutations associated with 501Y.V2,
              except for one infection that contained the E484K substitution in
              the receptor-binding domain. The 501Y.V2 virus variant was
              effectively neutralized by plasma from individuals who were
              infected during the second wave. The first-wave virus variant was
              effectively neutralized by plasma from first-wave infections.
              However, the 501Y.V2 variant was poorly cross-neutralized by
              plasma from individuals with first-wave infections; the efficacy
              was reduced by 15.1-fold relative to neutralization of 501Y.V2 by
              plasma from individuals infected in the second wave. By contrast,
              cross-neutralization of first-wave virus variants using plasma
              from individuals with second-wave infections was more effective,
              showing only a 2.3-fold decrease relative to neutralization of
              first-wave virus variants by plasma from individuals infected in
              the first wave. Although we tested only one plasma sample from an
              individual infected with a SARS-CoV-2 variant with only the E484K
              substitution, this plasma sample potently neutralized both
              variants. The observed effective neutralization of first-wave

              virus infection or response to current vaccination is the
              demonstration of a seroconversion, a fourfold or greater rise in

              The hemagglutination-inhibition assay is also used to monitor

              Neutralization assays using replication-incompetent pseudotyped

              quantifying the rate and pattern of adaptive evolution within

              of the HIV-1 env gene for viral populations from 50 different
              patients. I find that, averaging across patients, one adaptive
              substitution occurs every 3.3 months. Also, one adaptive mutation
              is driven to a high frequency (>50\% but <100\%) every 2.5
              months. Taken together, such adaptive events occur once every 25
              viral generations, which is the fastest adaptation rate ever
              recorded for a single protein-coding gene. Within the entire env

              nonsynonymous substitutions and high-frequency polymorphisms are
              adaptive. Further, in the C2-V5 region of env, I find that
              patients with longer asymptomatic periods have virus populations
              with higher adaptation rates, corroborating the notion that a
              broad, strong immune response against epitopes in the env gene

              infections. It is not known to what extent reinfection by these

              immune evasion of seasonal coronaviruses. We provide evidence

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: Norovirus is a highly transmissible infectious agent
              that causes epidemic gastroenteritis in susceptible children and
              adults. Norovirus infections can be severe and can be initiated
              from an exceptionally small number of viral particles. Detailed
              genome sequence data are useful for tracking norovirus
              transmission and evolution. To address this need, we have
              developed a whole-genome deep-sequencing method that generates
              entire genome sequences from small amounts of clinical specimens.
              This novel approach employs an algorithm for reverse
              transcription and PCR amplification primer design using all of
              the publically available norovirus sequence data. Deep sequencing
              and de novo assembly were used to generate norovirus genomes from
              a large set of diarrheal patients attending three hospitals in Ho
              Chi Minh City, Vietnam, over a 2.5-year period.
              Positive-selection analysis and direct examination of protein
              changes in the virus over time identified codons in the regions
              encoding proteins VP1, p48 (NS1-2), and p22 (NS4) under positive
              selection and expands the known targets of norovirus evolutionary
              pressure. IMPORTANCE: The high transmissibility and rapid
              evolutionary rate of norovirus, combined with a short-lived host
              immune responses, are thought to be the reasons why the virus
              causes the majority of pediatric viral diarrhea cases. The
              evolutionary patterns of this RNA virus have been described in
              detail for only a portion of the virus genome and never for a
              virus from a detailed urban tropical setting. We provide a
              detailed sequence description of the noroviruses circulating in
              three Ho Chi Minh City hospitals over a 2.5-year period. This
              study identified patterns of virus change in known sites of host
              immune response and identified three additional regions of the
              virus genome under selection that were not previously recognized.
              In addition, the method described here provides a robust

              with reduced influenza risk. While repeated influenza vaccination
              reduces seroresponse, vaccine effectiveness is not always
              reduced. METHODS: During the 2007-2008 influenza season, a
              randomized, placebo-controlled trial (FLUVACS) evaluated the
              efficacies of live-attenuated (LAIV) and inactivated influenza
              vaccines (IIV) among healthy adults aged 18-49 in Michigan; IIV
              vaccine efficacy (VE) and LAIV VE against influenza disease were
              estimated at 68\% and 36\%. Using the principal stratification/VE
              moderation framework, we analyzed data from this trial to assess
              how each VE varied by HAI or NAI responses to vaccination
              observed for vaccinated individuals and predicted
              counterfactually for placebo recipients. We also assessed how
              each VE varied with pre-vaccination/baseline variables including
              HAI titer, NAI titer, and vaccination history. RESULTS: IIV VE
              appeared to increase with Day 30 post-vaccination HAI titer,
              albeit not significantly (p=0.20 and estimated VE 14.4\%, 70.5\%,
              and 85.5\% at titer below the assay lower quantification limit,
              512, and 4096 (maximum)). Moreover, IIV VE increased
              significantly with Day 30 post-vaccination NAI titer (p=0.040),
              with estimated VE zero at titer 10 and 92.2\% at highest titer
              640. There was no evidence that fold-change in post-vaccination
              HAI or NAI titer associated with IIV VE (p=0.76, 0.38). For LAIV,
              there was no evidence that VE associated with post-vaccination or
              fold-rise HAI or NAI titers (p-values >0.40). For IIV, VE
              increased with increasing baseline NAI titer in those previously
              vaccinated, but VE decreased with increasing baseline NAI titer
              in those previously unvaccinated. In contrast, for LAIV, VE did
              not depend on previous vaccination or baseline HAI or NAI titer.
              CONCLUSIONS: Future efficacy trials should measure baseline and
              post-vaccination antibody titers in both vaccine and
              control/placebo recipients, enabling analyses to better elucidate
              correlates of vaccine- and natural-protection. TRIAL

  abstract = "At present, most analyses that aim to detect the action of
              natural selection upon viral gene sequences use phylogenetic
              estimates of the ratio of silent to replacement mutations. Such
              methods, however, are impractical to compute on large data sets
              comprising hundreds of complete viral genomes, which are becoming
              increasingly common due to advances in genome sequencing
              technology. Here we investigate the statistical performance of
              computationally efficient tests that are based on sequence
              summary statistics, and explore their applicability to RNA virus
              data sets in two ways. Firstly, we perform extensive simulations
              in order to measure the type I error of two well-known summary
              statistic methods - Tajima's D and the McDonald-Kreitman test -
              under a range of virus-like mutational and demographic scenarios.
              Secondly, we apply these methods to a compilation of
              approximately 100 RNA virus alignments that represent natural RNA
              virus populations. In addition, we develop and introduce a new
              implementation of the McDonald-Kreitman test and show that it
              greatly improves the test's statistical reliability on typical
              viral data sets. Our results suggest that variants of the
              McDonald-Kreitman test could prove useful in the analysis of very

              evolution in emerging viral outbreaks has become an important
              tool for scientists and public health officials. Although it is
              known that the degree of sequence divergence significantly
              affects the calculation of evolutionary metrics in viral
              outbreaks, the extent and duration of this effect during an
              actual outbreak remains unclear. We have analyzed how limited
              divergence time during an early viral outbreak affects the
              accuracy of molecular evolutionary metrics. Using sequence data
              from the first 25 months of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1)
              outbreak, we calculated each of three different standard
              evolutionary metrics-molecular clock rate (i.e., evolutionary
              rate), whole gene dN/dS, and site-wise dN/dS-for hemagglutinin
              and neuraminidase, using increasingly longer time windows, from 1
              month to 25 months. For the molecular clock rate, we found that
              at least three to four months of temporal divergence from the
              start of sampling was required to make precise estimates that
              also agreed with long-term values. For whole gene dN/dS, we found
              that at least two months of data were required to generate
              precise estimates, but six to nine months were required for
              estimates to approach their long term values. For site-wise dN/dS
              estimates, we found that at least six months of sampling
              divergence was required before the majority of sites had at least
              one mutation and were thus evolutionarily informative.
              Furthermore, eight months of sampling divergence was required
              before the site-wise estimates appropriately reflected the
              distribution of values expected from known
              protein-structure-based evolutionary pressure in influenza. In
              summary, we found that evolutionary metrics calculated from gene
              sequence data in early outbreaks should be expected to deviate
              from their long-term estimates for at least several months after
              the initial emergence and sequencing of the virus.",

              feasible, a structural and biochemical basis for the single
              serotype nature of measles virus (MV) remains to be provided. The
              hemagglutinin (H) protein, which binds to two discrete
              proteinaceous receptors, is the major neutralizing target.
              Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) recognizing distinct epitopes on the
              H protein were characterized using recombinant MVs encoding the H
              gene from different MV genotypes. The effects of various
              mutations on neutralization by MAbs and virus fitness were also
              analyzed, identifying the location of five epitopes on the H
              protein structure. Our data in the present study demonstrated
              that the H protein of MV possesses at least two conserved
              effective neutralizing epitopes. One, which is a previously
              recognized epitope, is located near the receptor-binding site
              (RBS), and thus MAbs that recognize this epitope blocked the
              receptor binding of the H protein, whereas the other epitope is
              located at the position distant from the RBS. Thus, a MAb that
              recognizes this epitope did not inhibit the receptor binding of
              the H protein, rather interfered with the hemagglutinin-fusion
              (H-F) interaction. This epitope was suggested to play a key role
              for formation of a higher order of an H-F protein oligomeric
              structure. Our data also identified one nonconserved effective
              neutralizing epitope. The epitope has been masked by an N-linked
              sugar modification in some genotype MV strains. These data would
              contribute to our understanding of the antigenicity of MV and

              cellular receptors of hemagglutinin (HA) to enable progeny escape
              from infected cells. However, NA variants (D151G) of recent human
              H3N2 viruses have also been reported to bind receptors on red
              blood cells, but the nature of these receptors and the effect of
              the mutation on NA activity were not established. Here, we
              compare the functional and structural properties of a human H3N2
              NA from A/Tanzania/205/2010 and its D151G mutant, which supports
              HA-independent receptor binding. While the wild-type NA
              efficiently cleaves sialic acid from both $\alpha$2-6- and
              $\alpha$2-3-linked glycans, the mutant exhibits much reduced
              enzymatic activity toward both types of sialosides. Conversely,
              while wild-type NA shows no detectable binding to sialosides, the
              D151G NA exhibits avid binding with broad specificity toward
              $\alpha$2-3 sialosides. D151G NA binds the 3' sialyllactosamine
              (3'-SLN) and 6'-SLN sialosides with equilibrium dissociation
              constant (K(D)) values of 30.0 $\mu$M and 645 $\mu$M,
              respectively, which correspond to much higher affinities than the
              corresponding affinities (low mM) of HA to these glycans. Crystal
              structures of wild-type and mutant NAs reveal the structural
              basis for glycan binding in the active site by exclusively
              impairing the glycosidic bond hydrolysis step. The general
              significance of D151 among influenza virus NAs was further
              explored by introducing the D151G mutation into three N1 NAs and
              one N2 NA, which all exhibited reduced enzymatic activity and
              preferential binding to $\alpha$2-3 sialosides. Since the
              enzymatic and binding activities of NAs are not routinely
              assessed, the potential for NA receptor binding to contribute to
              influenza virus biology may be underappreciated.",

  abstract = "In the vast majority of influenza A viruses characterized to
              date, hemagglutinin (HA) is the receptor-binding and fusion
              protein, whereas neuraminidase (NA) is a receptor-cleaving
              protein that facilitates viral release but is expendable for
              entry. However, the NAs of some recent human H3N2 isolates have
              acquired receptor-binding activity via the mutation D151G,
              although these isolates also appear to retain the ability to bind
              receptors via HA. We report here the laboratory generation of a
              mutation (G147R) that enables an N1 NA to completely co-opt the
              receptor-binding function normally performed by HA. Viruses with
              this mutant NA grow to high titers even in the presence of
              extensive mutations to conserved residues in HA's
              receptor-binding pocket. When the receptor-binding NA is paired
              with this binding-deficient HA, viral infectivity and red blood
              cell agglutination are blocked by NA inhibitors. Furthermore,
              virus-like particles expressing only the receptor-binding NA
              agglutinate red blood cells in an NA-dependent manner. Although
              the G147R NA receptor-binding mutant virus that we characterize
              is a laboratory creation, this same mutation is found in several
              natural clusters of H1N1 and H5N1 viruses. Our results
              demonstrate that, at least in tissue culture, influenza virus
              receptor-binding activity can be entirely shifted from HA to NA.",

              vaccines poorly display key NA epitopes and rarely induce

              induces NA-reactive B cells at a frequency that approaches (H1N1)

              original pandemic strains of both H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes. The
              antibodies robustly inhibit the enzymatic activity of NA,
