Host:    MacBook-Pro-2.local (SSE4.2, 8 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree2 -nt 1 -s results/aligned_fluC_PB1_Yamagata-delim.fasta -m GTR -ninit 2 -n 2 -me 0.05
Seed:    740535 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Mon Oct 24 17:43:42 2022
Kernel:  SSE2 - 1 threads (8 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 8 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
