Host:    macbook-pro-5.fhcrc.org (SSE4.2, 8 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree2 -nt 1 -s results/aligned_fluC_PB2_Yamagata-delim.fasta -m GTR -ninit 2 -n 2 -me 0.05
Seed:    953693 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Fri Aug 18 10:18:15 2023
Kernel:  SSE2 - 1 threads (8 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 8 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
