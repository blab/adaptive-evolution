Host:    kates-mbp-3.fhcrc.org (AVX2, FMA3, 8 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree2 -ninit 2 -n 2 -me 0.05 -nt 1 -s results/aligned_A_genome-delim.fasta -m GTR
Seed:    639468 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Wed Mar  9 12:32:09 2022
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (4 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 4 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file results/aligned_A_genome-delim.fasta ... Fasta format detected
