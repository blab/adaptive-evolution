Host:    MacBook-Pro-5.local (SSE4.2, 8 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree2 -nt 1 -s results/aligned_229e_S1-delim.fasta -m GTR -ninit 2 -n 2 -me 0.05
Seed:    289933 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Thu Jan 26 12:47:43 2023
Kernel:  SSE2 - 1 threads (8 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 8 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
