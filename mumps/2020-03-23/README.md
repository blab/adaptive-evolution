# nextstrain.org/mumps

This is the [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org) build for mumps virus, visible at
[nextstrain.org/mumps](https://nextstrain.org/mumps).

The build encompasses fetching data, preparing it for analysis, doing quality
control, performing analyses, and saving the results in a format suitable for
visualization (with [auspice][]).  This involves running components of
Nextstrain such as [fauna][] and [augur][].

All mumps-specific steps and functionality for the Nextstrain pipeline should be
housed in this repository.

## Usage

If you're unfamiliar with Nextstrain builds, you may want to follow our
[quickstart guide][] first and then come back here.

The easiest way to run this pathogen build is using the [Nextstrain
command-line tool][nextstrain-cli]:

    nextstrain build .

See the [nextstrain-cli README][] for how to install the `nextstrain` command.

Alternatively, you should be able to run the build using `snakemake` within an
suitably-configured local environment.  Details of setting that up are not yet
well-documented, but will be in the future.

Build output goes into the directories `data/`, `results/` and `auspice/`.

Once you've run the build, you can view the results in auspice:

    nextstrain view auspice/


## Configuration

Configuration takes place entirely with the `Snakefile`. This can be read top-to-bottom, each rule
specifies its file inputs and output and also its parameters. There is little redirection and each
rule should be able to be reasoned with on its own.


### fauna / RethinkDB credentials

This build starts by pulling sequences from our live [fauna][] database (a RethinkDB instance). This
requires environment variables `RETHINK_HOST` and `RETHINK_AUTH_KEY` to be set.

If you don't have access to our database, you can run the build using the
example data provided in this repository.  Before running the build, copy the
example sequences into the `data/` directory like so:

    mkdir -p data/
    cp example_data/mumps.fasta data/
